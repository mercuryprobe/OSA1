Custom Linux Shell in C

Introduction
rmnShell is a basic Linux shell written in C, designed to handle three internal and five
external commands.
The program consists of the main shell.c file, along with 5 external c files (and
corresponding header files), one for each external command. Further, there are two
structures (splitStruc and flagStruc), designed for obtaining the outputs
generated by flags.c and tokeniser.c. Finally, the makefile complies the program and
executes it. The shell operates by running the shell() function, which is the heart
of the entire program. References are commented in the code whenever required.
Linux man pages, stack exchange, and tutorialspoint were general sources for a lot
of information in general.
